# GSDA_for_Robotic_Arm
This is an implementation of the proposed Generalized Structured Diagonal Algorithm based on diagonal Hessian approximation
to solve a 3DOF(degrees of freedom) planar robot arm, manipulator.

The GSDA.m contains the implementation of the 3-DOF robotic model.
The GSDAfor3DOF.m is where the above GSDA.m is called, and simulations are carried out.
